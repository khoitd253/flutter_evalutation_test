# Requirements

This app will display drinks fetched from an API. After selecting the drinks, users can save
them to the cart. The basic flow is shown in the video above.

# Critical Notes

- DO NOT use any state management library.
- Any use of setState within the test will be considered a failure.
- The less you rely on third-party libraries, the greater your chances of surpassing your
  competitors.
- Prioritize both scalability and maintainability in your coding approach.
- Thoroughly review your work before submitting it to the tester.

# Submission of work

After you have finished your work, please submit it as followed:

- Push your code to github and public access
- Push all commits on the master(main) branch only
- Share github repo to tester

# Bonus Points

- Implemented design fully.
- The app is mobile responsive.
- Follow coding convention.
- Good project structural, readable code.
- Great commit messages.
